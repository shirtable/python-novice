Putting everything together
===========================
At this point, we've covered many topics including:

* variables
* strings (and some string methods)
* numbers
* lists
* dictionaries
* `for` loop
* Indentation and code blocks in Python
* reading/writing files
* `if` statements
* functions

We are going to spend the remainder of this workshop working through a few examples to deal with the baby name data and create a few visualizations.


Example problems
----------------
1. Read the data from the file and create a list of dictionaries.
2. Determine the number of babies born in 2012.
3. Determine the number of female babies born in 2012.
4. Determine the number of female babies born in 2012 with a five-letter name.
5. Determine the number of babies whos name starts with the letter "J".
