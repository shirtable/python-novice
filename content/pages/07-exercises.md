Title: Putting everything together
Category: Lessons

At this point, we've covered many topics including:

* variables
* strings (and some string methods)
* numbers
* lists
* dictionaries
* `for` loop
* Indentation and code blocks in Python
* reading/writing files
* `if` statements
* functions

We are going to spend the remainder of this workshop working through a few examples to deal with the baby name data and create a few visualizations.


Example problems
----------------
We should spend 15-30 minutes on the first exercise. People can put a green sticky when they've completed it and they can start working on the other exercises.

1. Create a function that reads the data from the file and create a list of dictionaries.
2. Determine the number of babies born in 2012.
3. Determine the number of female babies born in 2012.
4. Determine the number of female babies born in 2012 with a five-letter name.
5. Determine the number of babies whos name starts with the letter "J".
6. How many babies have four letter names?
7. How many female babies have names that start with "L"?
8. How many babies were born in 2010?
