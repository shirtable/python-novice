Introduction
============
The goal of this workshop is to take people with very little to no programming experience to the point of understanding the basics of programming in the Python language. By the end of this class you will have written some programs and will have been exposed to the following concepts:

* typeness
    * strings
    * numbers
    * lists, tuples
    * dictionaries
* loading data from a file (csv, JSON)
* writing data to a file (csv, JSON)
* functions
* errors and exceptions
* control statments (if, etc.)
* loops
* visualization
* importing modules and libraries
* the OOP nature of python
